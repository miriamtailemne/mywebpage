    <h1>
        Ubisoft
    </h1>
    <h4>April 2023 - Present</h4>
    <p>
        Working at Ubisoft for 2 years, I got to improve my problem solving,
        social and collaborative skills. Throughout my experience with 3 projects,
        I gathered experience with various tools and software such as
        Jira, Confluence, the Microsoft Office Suite and internal tools.
        <br><br>
        As a Game Tester, I had to find edge cases for tests, so that
        the given project was tested throughly and patiently. I was also
        put in the position of coordinating people and orchestrating tests
        so that they were executed efficiently and correctly.

        Burger King
    </h1>
    <h4>August 2022 - August 2022</h4>
    <p>
        At Burger King, I learned to work efficiently as part of a team, manage multiple tasks at a fast pace, and
        interact with customers to provide them with a pleasant experience. <br><br> I developed skills to work under
        pressure
        and learned to quickly adapt to new procedures in a dynamic environment. I also improved my communication and
        problem-solving skills, ensuring that customer concerns were addressed promptly and professionally.
        <br><br>Additionally, I gained valuable experience in maintaining high standards of cleanliness and food safety,
        contributing to a positive overall dining experience for customers.

        Ubisoft

    <h4>April 2023 - Present</h4>
    <p>
        I worked at Ubisoft for 2 years, where I improved my problem-solving, social, and collaborative skills.
        Throughout my experience on 3 projects, I gained expertise in using various tools and software, including Jira,
        Confluence, the Microsoft Office Suite, and internal tools.<br><br>

        As a Game Tester, I was responsible for thoroughly testing games, identifying edge cases, and ensuring that each
        project was tested with precision and patience. I also gained strong skills in managing and tracking issues,
        collaborating with teams, and verifying fixes.<br><br>
        My role required a keen eye for detail, as I had to accurately
        reproduce issues and document them for development teams. Additionally, I was often tasked with coordinating
        people and orchestrating tests to ensure they were executed efficiently and correctly. This experience allowed
        me to contribute significantly to the overall quality and player experience of the games, while also enhancing
        my ability to communicate effectively and solve technical problems.

    <h4>August 2022 - August 2022</h4>
    <p>
        At Burger King, I learned to work efficiently as part of a team, manage multiple tasks at a fast pace, and
        interact with customers to provide them with a pleasant experience. <br><br> I developed skills to work under
        pressure
        and learned to quickly adapt to new procedures in a dynamic environment. I also improved my communication and
        problem-solving skills, ensuring that customer concerns were addressed promptly and professionally.
        <br><br>Additionally, I gained valuable experience in maintaining high standards of cleanliness and food safety,
        contributing to a positive overall dining experience for customers.

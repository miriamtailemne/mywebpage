    <p>In my free time, I’m passionate about gaming and a variety of creative activities such as drawing and reading.
        Gaming offers me a chance to dive into different worlds, engage with complex storylines, and challenge myself
        with new puzzles and strategies. It’s not just entertainment for me; it’s an experience that stimulates my mind
        and fuels my creativity. <br><br>

        In addition to these hobbies, I’m also passionate about coding, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
        find it exciting to bring ideas to life on the web, whether it’s building a simple webpage or creating more
        interactive experiences. Coding challenges me to think critically and problem-solve, and it’s rewarding to see
        my work take shape and function as I envision it.<br><br>

        In my childhood, I was a passionate basketball player and had the honor of being a national champion in women’s
        basketball. Competing at such a high level taught me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of perseverance.
        Those experiences shaped my work ethic and helped me develop a strong sense of determination, both on and off
        the court. Being part of a championship team not only boosted my confidence but also instilled in me the value
        of collaboration and pushing myself to always give my best.<br><br>


        These activities not only bring me joy but also help me develop valuable skills, stimulate my creativity, and
        provide a healthy balance to my routine.<br><br>
